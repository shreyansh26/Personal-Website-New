I am currently working as a **Lead Machine Learning Engineer at [LevelAI](https://thelevel.ai/)**. My team is is spread across India, USA & Canada and we primarily work on solving challenging NLP problems at scale to extract and deliver insights from contact-center conversations. Previously, I was working at [Mastercard's AI Garage](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mastercard-ai-garage/) as a Data Scientist where we were leveraging AI to make the transactions world a smarter and secure place. In my corporate experience, I have mainly worked on **applied research**, meaning I have been involved both in incorporating AI and Machine Learning in product development <u>(leading to product launches/patents)</u> as well as pure research work <u>(publishing papers at AI conferences)</u>.

I did my **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT (BHU) Varanasi**. My B.Tech thesis advisor was [**Prof. K.K. Shukla**](https://iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/kkshuklacse). I worked on privacy-preserving Machine Learning and its application in the medical industry. Previously I had also worked with him on Adversarial Machine Learning and Malware classification problems. In summer 2019, I was an intern at [**Samsung Research Institute - Bangalore**](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b), working on mobility in 5G networks. I also worked as a research intern at the [**C3i Institute, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur**](https://security.cse.iitk.ac.in/) on Malware Detection for Linux, in winter 2018.  In summer 2018, I was a Data Science intern at [**Innoplexus, Pune (India)**](https://www.innoplexus.com/), working with the Computer Vision team. I have also worked with [**Dr. Anil Kumar Singh**](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/aksinghcse), on sentiment analysis on product reviews and natural language generation through shared tasks at conferences.

When not working on research, I enjoy playing CTFs ([wr47h](https://ctftime.org/team/34870)), either solo or with my team [**Abs0lut3Pwn4g3**](https://ctftime.org/team/72103). I also enjoy competitive programming and reading novels.
